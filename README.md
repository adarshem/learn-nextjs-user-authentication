## Project Overview
This project is a hands-on learning experience to understand how to implement **user authentication** and **authorization** in a Next.js application. The goal is to explore:
- User registration and login.
- Session management.
- Protected routes.
- Role-based access control (if applicable).

The project uses **Lucia Auth**, a lightweight and flexible authentication library, and **better-sqlite3** for database storage.

---

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can create an account with an email and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts.
- **Session Management**: Persistent user sessions using cookies.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Database Integration**: User details are stored in a SQLite database using `better-sqlite3`.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Lucia Auth**: A lightweight authentication library for handling user sessions and authentication logic.
- **better-sqlite3**: A fast and lightweight SQLite database for storing user details.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development.

## Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration**:
   - The user submits their email and password via the registration form.
   - The credentials are validated and stored in the SQLite database.
   - A new session is created, and the user is logged in.

2. **User Login**:
   - The user submits their email and password via the login form.
   - The credentials are verified against the database.
   - If valid, a session is created, and the user is logged in.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions are stored in cookies and validated on each request.
   - Protected routes check for a valid session before allowing access.

4. **Logout**:
   - The user's session is destroyed, and they are logged out.
